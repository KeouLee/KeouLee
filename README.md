Hello, I meet the same problem. And when I try to check convergence of virial (according to the dp tutorial https://tutorials.deepmodeling.com/en/latest/CaseStudies/Convergence-Test/Convergence-Test.html), I find that my VASP OUTCAR gives a 3x3 matrix for virial, how can I convert this matrix to a scalar just as the 'delta' plotted in the deepmd tutorials? Thanks in advance!
